## Next Steps for Full Management Capabilities

To enable full create/update/delete capabilities through CLI:

1. **Verify User Permissions**:
   - Log in to staging admin
   - Go to Users → All Users
   - Ensure your user account has appropriate permissions

2. **Test Write Operations**:
   - Run `node staging-management.js` again
   - Check if create/update operations work

3. **Alternative WP-CLI Approach**:
   - For complex operations, you can use the web admin interface
   - The CLI tools are best for automation and scripting

## Best Practices

1. **Always test on staging first** before making changes to production
2. **Use descriptive names** for Application Passwords
3. **Regularly review** Application Passwords and remove unused ones
4. **Keep environment files secure** and never commit passwords to version control

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify the staging URL is accessible in your browser
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Verify the Application Password is correct
   - Ensure no extra spaces in the password

3. **Permission Errors**:
   - Check user account permissions in WordPress
   - Consider creating a dedicated user for CLI operations
