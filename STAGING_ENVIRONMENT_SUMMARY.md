## Environment Configuration Files

Located in `mcp-wordpress-server/` directory:

1. **.env.production** - Configuration for live site
2. **.env.staging** - Configuration for staging site
3. **.env** - Currently active environment (should match one of the above)

## Switching Between Environments

### To switch to staging:
```
cd mcp-wordpress-server
.\use-staging.bat
```

### To switch to production:
```
cd mcp-wordpress-server
.\use-production.bat
```

## Required Setup Steps

### For CLI Access to Staging:

1. **Create Application Password**:
   - Log in to staging admin
   - Go to Users â†’ Profile
   - Scroll to "Application Passwords"
   - Create new password named "MCP Staging CLI"
   - Copy the generated password

2. **Update Configuration**:
   - Edit `mcp-wordpress-server/.env.staging`
   - Replace placeholder with actual Application Password
   - Save the file

3. **Test Connection**:
   ```
   node test-environment-connection.js
   ```

## Available Management Tools

### Custom Scripts:

## Best Practices

1. **Always test on staging first**
   - Make changes on staging before applying to production
   - Verify functionality and appearance

2. **Use appropriate tools for tasks**
   - Web admin for content creation and visual changes
   - CLI for automated or repetitive tasks

3. **Keep environments synchronized**

4. **Document changes**
   - Keep track of what changes were made where
   - Note whether changes were made via admin or CLI

## Next Steps

1. Set up Application Password for staging CLI access
2. Test connection to staging environment
3. Experiment with management scripts
4. Familiarize yourself with both admin and CLI workflows
5. Begin testing changes on staging before applying to production
